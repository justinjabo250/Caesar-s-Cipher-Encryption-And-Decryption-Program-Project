# Caesar-s-Cipher-Encryption

### My goal for this project was to create software that functions in a certain way. When encrypting, the message's letters are found in the "plain" line, and the corresponding letter is written in the "cipher" line. This can be used as a form of data security because you can send encrypted data to someone else and let him decrypt it when needed. I therefore intended to use Python technology to build this software program. I hope that it will be useful for any user who wants to perform any encryption on text and descript it when it is needed.

**In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.**

**It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.**

**For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.**

**The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions.**

**For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key):**

**Plain:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ**

**Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW**

**When encrypting, a person looks up each letter of the message in the “plain” line and writes down the corresponding letter in the “cipher” line.**



**Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD**

**Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG**

**Deciphering is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3.**
